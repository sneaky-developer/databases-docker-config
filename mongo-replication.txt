Mongo Replication 

- [1] Installation is done using .sh file by just executing it mongo is working


Next editing the configuration file 


- [2] In hosts file adding the hosts name and Ip-address of the other containers
Your /etc/hosts would look like this

 172.17.0.2	 3bf8bb324f1b
 172.17.0.3	4bd2169af393
 172.17.0.4	4890c1246a98

- [3] Now moving to the /etc/mongod.conf  Adding following configurations in .yaml file

replication:
  replSetName: "rs1‚Äù


Am running the mongo In each mongo ubuntu container having mongo service

- [3] Now randomly going to any container and running this command make that mongo as primary
rs.initiate()


- [4] And then adding the node in primary node using this command
rs.add({host:'4890c1246a98:27017',priority:0})

NOTE:
Priority 0 means there is no chance of this node to become master
Priority 1 means higher chances
Priority 0 to 1 means the priority of the node varies


- [5] Now deleting the node using this command
rs.remove('4890c1246a98:27017')


To check the status we will use the command
rs.status()

To check the configuratio of the nodes will be using this command
rs.config()
