Replication

Creating there different containers and installing ubuntu:20.04 in it
And then installing mongoldb in it

Now from the mongod.conf need to add the bind ips 
{setled down the ip in my file is 0.0.0.0 } 

Now added the replicates “rs1” in all conf files of the configuration

The ip of the primary host should be in the mongo.conf file of both nodes and the ip of both nodes should be in the conf file of primary ip. I you want  to add hostname instead of ip. Then change the /etc/host file of mongo and ad the ip against the host name
Start the mongo in all the servers
In primary server run the command rs.initiate().
The add the nodes with the command rs.add(“ip or host name of slave nod”)




PITR (point in time recovery)
For PITR replication should must be working
For the task we created the database and added some data took backup then added some more data and then deleted the data to recover it from the logs
Now we are taking whole oplog backup though below command.

Mongodump   - d local  -c ‘oplog.rs’  --out desination
Or
mongodump --oplog --out /home

For point in time recovery you must need to know the timestamp of the records deleted.

d=db.getSiblingDB("local")
d.oplog.rs.find({"ns":"test.mycol1","op":"d"}).sort({$natural:1}).limit(5)

Here we are checking last deleted records timestamp through below command.

d=db.getSiblingDB("local")
d.oplog.rs.find({"ns":"test.mycol1","op":"d"}).sort({$natural:-1}).limit(5)

Then we renamed the files names in the oplong backup directory   noticed the timespan for the inserted data from the logs which got listed with the above commands

Used the following command to restore the logs
mongorestore --oplogReplay --oplogLimit 1533210442:1 ./
Or 
mongorestore --oplogReplay --oplogLimit 1693561277 /home

Replace the timespan with the required one.
